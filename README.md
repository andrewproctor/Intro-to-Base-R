## Course Structure and Getting Started

A DataCamp course consists of two types of files:

- `course.yml`, a <a href=http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html target="_blank">YAML-formatted file</a> that's prepopulated with some general course information.
- `chapterX.md`, a markdown file with:
   - a YAML header containing chapter information.
   - markdown chunks representing DataCamp Exercises.

To learn more about the structure of a DataCamp course, check out the <a href=https://www.datacamp.com//teach/documentation#tab_course_structure target="_blank">documentation</a>.

Every DataCamp exercise consists of different parts, read up about them <a href=https://www.datacamp.com//teach/documentation#tab_code_exercises target="_blank">here</a>. A very important part about DataCamp exercises is to provide automated personalized feedback to students. In R, these so-called Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) are written with the <a href=https://github.com/datacamp/testwhat target="_blank">`testwhat`</a> package. SCTs for Python exercises are coded up with <a href=https://github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat target="_blank">`pythonwhat`</a>. Check out the GitHub repositories' wiki pages for more information and examples.
